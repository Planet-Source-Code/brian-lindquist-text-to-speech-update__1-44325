### Description

This is a text to speech program that allows you to type in text/load text files and have the voice repeat it, you can also copy/paste say news articles, emails, etc., you can also alter the way the voice sounds. NOTE: This only works with Windows 2000. From past feedback it sounds like windows NT & XP aren't compatible with this :( This requires XVOICE.DLL. if you don't have the DLL i've just posted the XVOICE.DLL file on the net.

ftp://65.108.102.55/pub/Xvoice.zip

the link IS case sensitive.
